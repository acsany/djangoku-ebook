// Explain the WHY (book and topic)

There are many tutorials on Django.
But deployment is often not part of it.

So one is left with blog posts and documentation pages.
The information is there, but it is cumbersome to connect all the dots.

With this book I try to provide a concise tutorial on how to deploy Django projects via GitLab to Heroku.

Every chapter ends with a checklist.
Once you’ve completed all steps for a project, you can use the checklists as quick references.

[NOTE]
When I started learning programming, I often abandonded tutorials and books, because _my_ code didn’t work like the one in the book.

I want you to succeed and finish this book.
If your code does not work as expected or you encounter a roadblock, don’t hesitate to contact me and I will try to help out.
