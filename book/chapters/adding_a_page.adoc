== Adding a page

Currently we see a placeholder page when we visit the Django project in the browser.
As wireframe for future additions, letâ€™s create a minimal app in Django.

The app will serve a welcome page when visiting the root of our project and contain some styling.
With the welcome page we can see if Django works correctly even when the debug mode is deactivated.
With the added styling, we will see if static files are served correctly.

=== Create the app

The purpose of this app is to serve static pages â€“ so we name it _pages_.

Create the _pages_ app:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py startapp pages
----

Add the _pages_ app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in the settings file:

.djangoku/settings.py (Around line 45)
[source, Python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other installed apps like django.contrib.*
    'pages',
]
----

=== Add urls

Now that the _pages_ app is present, we need to tell Django that we want to serve the _pages_ urls on root level.

Include `pages.urls` to `urlpatterns` of the main _djangoku_ urls file:

.djangoku/urls.py
[source, Python]
----
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

# Do not forget to import `include` from django.urls
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('pages.urls'))
]
----

Create an urls file for the _pages_ app:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
touch pages/urls.py
----

Add `welcome` path to _urls.py_:

.pages/urls.py
[source, Python]
----
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.welcome, name='welcome'),
]
----

=== Add welcome view

The root of our project now directs to the _welcome_ view.
This view does not exist yet; letâ€™s create it!

Add `welcome` function to _pages/views.py_

.pages/views.py (Around line 4)
[source, Python]
----
def welcome(request):
    content = {
        "welcome_msg": "Hello!",
        }
    template = "pages/welcome.html"
    return render(request, template, content)
----

=== Add the welcome page template

The view currently tries to render a template that does not exist yet.
To keep the modular structure of our project, we create it in a subdirectory of the _pages_ app.

Create the subdirectory for _pages_ templates and create the _welcome_ template:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
mkdir -p pages/templates/pages
touch pages/templates/pages/welcome.html
----

[NOTE]
The repetition of the app name in the path of the template is to prevent confusion between templates of the same name in different apps.

Add content to the _welcome_ template:

.pages/templates/pages/welcome.html
[source, Python]
----
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>djangoku</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/pages.css' %}" type="text/css" />

</head>

<body>
    <h1>{{welcome_msg}}</h1>
</body>
</html>
----

=== Add the CSS file

As you can see we referenced a css file that does not exist yet.

Create _pages.css_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
mkdir -p pages/static/css
touch pages/static/css/pages.css
----

Add basic styling to _pages.css_:

.pages/static/css/pages.css
[source, CSS]
----
body {
    background-color: ghost;
}

h1 {
    text-align: center;
    font-family: monospace;
}
----

=== Commit the code

Now we can stage and commit our changes:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Add pages app ðŸ“”"
----

=== Checklist

==== âœ”ï¸Ž App is created
==== âœ”ï¸Ž App shows a welcome page
