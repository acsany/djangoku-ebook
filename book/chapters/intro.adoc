// Explain the WHY (book and topic)

Every chapter ends with a checklist.
That way you can quickly reference important steps, without the noise.

When I started learning programming, I often abandonded tutorials and books, because _my_ code didn’t work like the one in the book.
I want you to succeed and finish this book.
If your code does not work as expected or you encounter a roadblock, don’t hesitate to contact me and I will try to help out.
