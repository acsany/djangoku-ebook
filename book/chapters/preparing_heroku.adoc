== Preparing Heroku

What we have so far is a basic Django project.
With everything we did so far, we have a decent basis to extend the project by adding a superuser, apps, models, views, templates, etc.

=== Create a Heroku app

Verify that you are logged in with the correct Heroku user:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
heroku auth:whoami
----

Choose a unqiue name and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/regions[region] for your Heroku app.

Then create your Heroku app with the _Heroku CLI_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
# Important: Change {appname} to a unique app name and {region} to your preferred region.
heroku apps:create {appname} --region {region}
----

=== Add a new secret key to Heroku
Heroku relies on env variables the same way we did on your local system.
Heroku will set the URL to the database itself.
But `SECRET_KEY` must be set by us.

It is a good idea to create a separate `SECRET_KEY` for each environment.

Letâ€™s create a new one the same way as before.

Start the Django shell in the terminal:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py shell
----

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key

get_random_secret_key()
----

Copy the output (e.g. `'NEWLY%G3GENERATEDsecret_KEY!'`).

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
# Important:
# * Change {appname} to your app name
# * CHange {secretkey} to your secret key
heroku config:set -a {appname} SECRET_KEY={secretkey}
----

[NOTE]
You may also set the `DEBUG` env variable.
The way we configured it in _settings.py_ it defaults to `False` when not set â€“ which is recommended for the app on Heroku.


=== Create a Procfile with Gunicorn

All Heroku applications require a _Procfile_.
This file must be located in the root of the project.
It declares how Heroku should run your application.

For Django we will tell Heroku to run  a _Gunicorn_ server for us.

Create a _Procfile_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
echo web: gunicorn djangoku.wsgi > Procfile
----

[NOTE]
If you named your project differently, you need to adjust the command above accordingly.

Install `gunicorn`:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip install gunicorn
----

=== Expand allowed hosts

Django checks for the _HTTP_HOST header_ of requests.
It rejects requests coming from urls that are not part of the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in the settings.

You need to add the url of your Heroku app and any custom domains that you may use for the project.

Add the url of the Heroku app to _settings.py_:

.djangoku/settings.py (Around line 33)
[source, Python]
----
# Important:
# Replace {appname} with your Heroku app name

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "{appname}.herokuapp.com",
]
----


=== Update our requirements

Now that we have a new module in our project, letâ€™s update our requirements.

Update _requirements.txt_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

=== Commit the code

If you run `git status` you will see, that we updated _requirements.txt_ and _settings.py_, and added _Procfile_.

Now we can stage and commit our changes:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare Heroku app ðŸ”Œ"
----
