== Handling static files

At one point or another you want to add assets like CSS files, JavaScript files or images to your project.

The https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3[adviced solution] is to store the files externally (like an AWS S3 bucket).
For prototypes or smaller projects it is easier to let Django serve the static files on production as well.
While Django handles static files locally just fine, the Heroku app needs a bit of configuration.

=== Add `django-heroku`

With https://github.com/heroku/django-heroku[django-heroku] Heroku provides a handy Python package that helps dealing with configuration settings for Heroku.
Especially the handling of settings, static files and logging is much easier with it.

PIP grabs all required dependencies when installing `django-heroku`.
This includes:

* `dj-database-url``
* `whitenoise`
* `psycopg2`
* `django` (We already have this one! ðŸ˜‰)

Install `django-heroku`:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip install django-heroku
----

Add it to our _settings.py_ file:

.djangoku/settings.py (At the bottom of the file)
[source, Python]
----
import django_heroku
django_heroku.settings(locals())
----

=== Update our requirements

Now that we have two new modules in our project, letâ€™s update our requirements.

Update _requirements.txt_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

=== Commit the code

If you run `git status` you will see, that we updated _requirements.txt_ and _settings.py_.

Now we can stage and commit our changes:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Configure static files handling ðŸ“‚"
----
