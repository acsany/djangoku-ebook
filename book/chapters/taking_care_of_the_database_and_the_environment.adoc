== Taking care of the Database and the Environment

Now that the basic local setup is in place, it is time to enhance it a bit.
In this chapter we will connect Django with a PostgreSQL database and make use of environment variables.

Another advantage is, that we can set different values in different environments (hence the name).

Create an _.env_ file:

.Terminal (same window)
[source, shell]

Add the _.env_ file to _.gitignore_:

.Terminal (same window)
[source, shell]
----
echo .env >> .gitignore
