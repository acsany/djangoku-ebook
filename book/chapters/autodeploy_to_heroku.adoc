== Autodeploy to Heroku

We prepared everything, so our production pipeline to Heroku is triggered by a push to our remote Git repository.
So we will only do one thing and then sit and watch.

Push the changes to GitLab:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git push origin master
----

Now you can visit _CI/CD -> Pipeline_ on your GitLab project page to see the pipelines running.
After that check out _Activity_ on your Heroku app page to see the build process.

If everything worked out, you should see the Django placeholer page when you click the _Open app_ button on Heroku or visit your project url directly.

=== It is live!
Congratulations!
You successfully deployed your Django app via GitLab to Heroku.

Now you can work on your project and quickly ship new features -- deployment wonâ€™t be holding you back.
