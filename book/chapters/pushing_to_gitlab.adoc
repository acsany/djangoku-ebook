== Pushing to GitLab

So far we have only worked locally.
In this chapter we will create a remote repository on GitLab to push our code to.

=== Creating the GitLab project

Gitlab has the functionality to create a new project by non-existant repositories by https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html#push-to-create-a-new-project[_just pushing to them_].
The repository is set to _private_ by default.
You can change that in the GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html#how-to-change-project-visibility[project settings].

[NOTE]
If you feel more comfortable to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html#push-to-create-a-new-project[use the GitLab website], that’s fine too.
Just make sure the remote repository is empty, so we can push to it without  pulling it first and maybe even running into merge conflicts.

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
## Important: Change {username} to your GitLab username
git push --set-upstream git@gitlab.com:{username}/djangoku.git master
----

This command created the project on GitLab and pushed the current state of our local repository to the remote repository.
However, it did not _add_ the the remote repository.

So, let’s do this:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
## Important: Change {username} to your GitLab username
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:{username}/djangoku.git
----

=== Creating a Readme file

Since our project is still missing a Readme file, now is finally the time to create one.
Feel free to add any content you want to the Readme file.
Do not add any sensitive data to it, as it will be tracked by Git and may be exposed to the public.

Create a _Readme.md_ file:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
echo "#Djangoku" > Readme.md
----

[INFO]
https://reinteractive.com/posts/137-on-the-importance-of-a-readme[This blog post] by Raphael Campardou lists what makes a good readme file.

=== Commit and push updates

If you run `git status` you will see, that we added _Readme.md_.

Now we can stage, commit and push it to GitLab:

.Terminal (same window)
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Add Readme 🐌"
git push origin master
----

=== Checklist

====  ✔︎ Remote repository is added

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git remote -v
----
-> Shows `origin` with url as _fetch_ and _push_  remote.

====  ✔︎ Remote repository is up to date

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git diff origin/master
----
-> Outputs nothing.
