== Taking care of the Environment

Now that the basic local setup is in place, it is time to enhance it a bit.
In this chapter we will start to make use of environment variables.

=== Create and ignore an _.env_ file

Important data should not live in your code or be part of the version control.
That’s where environment variables come in handy.
Another advantage is, that we can set different values in different environments (hence the name).

Locally we will store the environment variables in an _.env_ file.
Later on GitLab and Heroku, those variables can be defined in the settings.

Create an _.env_ file:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
touch .env
----

Let’s ignore the _.env_ file to prevent Git from tracking the content of it.

Add the _.env_ file to _.gitignore_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
echo .env >> .gitignore
----

=== Load necessary modules

To easily load and get environment variables in Django, we use the `python-dotenv` module.

Add `python-dotenv` to the project:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip install python-dotenv
----

Import  `os` and `python`dotenv` to the Django settings and load it:

.djangoku/settings.py (Beginning of the file)
[source, Python]
----
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
----

=== Create an easy DEBUG switch

The Django debug mode should be https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/checklist/#debug[turned off] in production.
Locally or in a staging environment it might be useful to see the Django debug messages.
That’s why we want to set the debug mode for the environment separately.

Change the value of `DEBUG` from `True` to this:

.djangoku/settings.py::23
[source, Python]
----
DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', default=False) == "True"
----

This statement does look a bit odd, so let’s see what it does:

1. `os.getenv` tries to get the `DEBUG` env variable.
2. If `DEBUG` is not set as an env variable, `DEBUG` defaults to `False`.
3. If the env variable is set to `"True"`, `DEBUG` is set to `True`.

[IMPORTANT]
Mind that environment variables are read as strings. Therefore we must check for a `"True"` string, not a boolean.

When you run Django server now you will see that Django does not run in debug mode.
(You may even see this: `CommandError: You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.`)
Locally we want to continue to see debug messages.

Add `DEBUG` variable to the _.env_ file and set it to `True`:

.'.env'
[source, shell]
----
echo "export DEBUG=True" >> .env
----

When you re-run the Django server you will see that Django does run in debug mode again.

=== Add another secret to the _.env_ file

[quote, 'Django Documentation, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/checklist/#secret-key[Deployment Checklist]']
____
The secret key must be a large random value and it must be kept secret.
____


[TIP]
See this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/47117966[_stack overflow_ answer]) to learn more about the purpose of the secret key.

When you have a look in the settings file around _line 23_ you see the current value of Django’s `SECRET_KEY`.

.djangoku/settings.py::23
[source, Python]
----
# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = 'mp#qzy1(u!!)ch!s7-d@4rybwz2-r5^l%cy699=v=uyqo%ucsv'
----

Since we already added this file to Git, we need to create a new `SECRET_KEY`, add it to our _.env_ file as a variable and reference it in the settings file.

Start the Django shell in the terminal:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py shell
----

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key

get_random_secret_key()
----

Copy the output (e.g. `'NEWLY%G3GENERATEDsecret_KEY!'`) and add it to the _.env_ file:

.'.env'
[source, shell]
----
export SECRET_KEY='NEWLY%G3GENERATEDsecret_KEY!'
----

Replace the `SECRET_KEY` string with a reference to the environment variable:

.djangoku/settings.py (Beginning of the file)
[source, Python]
----
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
----

Run `python manage.py runserver` to see if the server starts as expected.

=== Commit updates

When you run `git status` you will see, that we changed _.gitignore_ and _djangoku/settings.py_.

[IMPORTANT]
You should not see the _.env_ file listed when you run `git status`.
If you do, check if it was added correctly to _.gitignore_.

Before we commit our changes, we have to update _requirements.txt_:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

When you run `git status` you should see that _requirements.txt_ is part of the modified files list.

Now we can stage and commit all changes:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Work with env variables 🔐"
----


=== Checklist

*Objective*: The project works with an *_.env* file to load environment variables.

===  ✔︎ _.env_ exists
.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
cat .env
----
-> Outputs the contents of the _.env_ file including `DEBUG` and `SECRET_KEY`

===  ✔︎ _.env_ is not tracked in Git
.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git ls-files --error-unmatch .env
----
-> Outputs `error: pathspec '.env' did not match any file(s) known to git`

===  ✔︎ _.env_ is ignored by Git
.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git check-ignore .env
----
-> Outputs `.env`

===  ✔︎ Django can access the env variables

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py shell
----

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from django.conf import settings

load_dotenv()

settings.SECRET_KEY == os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
----
-> Outputs `True`
