== Connecting the database

Every environment will have their own database.
On Heroku, the database will be created automatically.
Locally we have to create the database on our own.

=== Creating the local PostgrSQL database
// TODO: Add chapter
As described before, we ignored the SQLite database to create our own PostgreSQL database.
So let’s do this.

Open postgres shell:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
psql
----

[NOTE]
If the `psql` command fails, you may have forgotten to start the Postgres server.


You can use your own database name.
I like to use a database name that is a combination of the project name and the environment.
That way it is easy to find it when there are multiple databases.
And it is clear which environment the database is meant for.

Create the database:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
CREATE DATABASE djangoku_local;
----

[IMPORTANT]
Do not forget the `;` at the end

Quit postgres shell:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
\q
----

=== Adding database modules

For Django and Heroku to be able work with PostgrSQL databases, we need two additional modules.

`psycopg2` is a database adapter, that enables Django to _talk_ to the PostgreSQL database.
`dj-database-url` allows us to use database urls.
This is not important in our local environment, but will be on Heroku.
Heroku stores the database url in an environment URL, that we access in the Django settings.

Let’s install both packages:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip install psycopg2 dj-database-url
----

And update our _requirements.txt_ file:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

=== Connecting Django and the database

Now that we have the prerequisites for our PostgreSQL database in place, it is time to clean up a bit.

==== Deleting the old …

Finally we can get rid of the _db.sqlite3_ database.
Just make sure that you first follow the steps to add the PostgreSQL databas below, before restarting the Django server.
If you don’t Django will just recreate the file.

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
rm db.sqlite3
----

==== … adding the new

The data Django needs to connect to the PostgreSQL database is sensitive information.
That’s one reason why we will store them in our _.env_ file.
Another advantage of this is that we can connect to different databases on different environments.

We will add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to the _.env_ file, that contains all information to connect to the database.
It will look like this:
`DATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@{host_name}:{port}/{database_name`

Before we add it to the _.env_ file, let’s look at the segments of the `DATABSE_URL`:

|===
| Segment | Info | Default value
| `user` | The user you want to connect with to the database| `postgres`
| `password` | The password for the user | ` ` _(no password)_
| `host_name` | The database host | `localhost`
| `port` | The database port | `5432`
| `database_name` | The database name you chose before | `djangoku_local`
|===

Let’s combine the segments to a functional url and add it to _.env_:

..env
[source, shell]
----
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/djangoku_local
----

Now we need to tell Django to use this database instead of the standard SQLite database by importing `dj_database_url` into `djangoku/settings.py` and adjusting the `DATABASES` variable.

Import `dj_database_url`:

.djangoku/settings.py (At the beginning of the file)
[source, Python]
----
import dj_database_url
----

Replace the current value of `DATABASES` with this:

//TODO: Check if require ssl should be set
//TODO: Add note about conn_max_age

.djangoku/settings.py (Around line 78)
[source, Python]
----
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=600)
}
----

Try `python manage.py runserver` to see if Django starts as expected.

[NOTE]
If you deleted _db.sqlite3_ before starting the server, it _should not_ be recreated by Django automatically on launch.
If it does, you need to check your settings again.


=== Commit updates

If you run `git status` you will see, that we changed _requirements.txt_ and _djangoku/settings.py_.

Now we can stage and commit all changes:

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Connect PostgreSQL database 🗄"
----

=== Checklist

====  ✔︎ db.sqlite3 is deleted

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
test -f db.sqlite3 || echo "deleted"
----
-> Outputs `"deleted"`

==== ✔︎ PostgreSQL database is present

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
psql --list
----
-> `djangoku_local` is present in the database list output.

====  ✔︎ DATABASE_URL is parsed correctly

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py shell
----

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
from django.conf import settings

settings.DATABASES['default']
----
-> Outputs a dictionary with correct values for `NAME`, `USER`, `HOST`, `PORT`

====  ✔︎ Django runs correctly

.Terminal
[source, shell]
----
python manage.py runserver
----
-> Development server starts
