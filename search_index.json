you need to start","keywords":"","body":"\nWhat you need to start\n\n\nTo take the most of this book you need basic knowledge in Python, Django and Git.\nThat said the setup you will encounter in the next chapters is kept as basic as possible, so even beginners can follow along.\n\n\nThis book will be based on the version stated in the list below.\nIt is possible to follow the steps with different versions.\nThe general steps will be the same, but there might be small differences.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\nPython 3.8+\n\n\nGit\n\n\nPostgreSQL 11+\n\n\nGitLab Account\n\n\nHeroku Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis version of the book assumes you are using\nMacOS.\nYou can follow this book on Windows and Linux as well by adjusting the commands accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPython and Git\n\nMake sure you have Python and Git installed on your system.\nThe easiest way is to google install python 3 on mac and install git on mac.\nChances are that Python and Git are already available on your system.\nWhile the Git version is not that important, your Python version should be version 3 or above.\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nGenerally speaking you can work with any database that Django and Heroku support.\n(Note: SQLite is not supported).\nThis book is based on PostgreSQL, because you don’t need any additional elements on Heroku and it is easy to setup on Django.\nSince we are only setting up the database and not do specific interactions with it, the PostgreSQL version you are using is not significant.\nTo see if your version works with Heroku, see this list.\n\n\n\nGitLab account\n\nTo follow along you need an GitLab account.\n\n\nWhy GitLab and not Github?\n\n\nUsually it does not matter that much if you use GitLab or GitHub.\nGitHub is comfortably integrated in Heroku.\nYou can even create GitHub actions to create similar workflows for your Heroku deployment, as we do with GitLab in this book.\nI personally find working with the GitLab CI/CD pipeline more convenient.\n\n\n\nHeroku account and Heroku CLI\n\nLast but not least, you obviously need an Heroku account to deploy your Django app on Heroku.\nThe good thing about Heroku is, that it is free (how we use it) and scalable (if needed).\n\n\nPlease make also sure that you have installed the Heroku Commandline Interface (CLI).\n\n\n\n\nChecklist\n\n✔︎ Python 3+ is installed\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\npython --version\n\n\n\n→ Outputs python version 3+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on how you installed Python 3, you have to use python3 --version or even python3.8 --version instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✔︎ Git is installed\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\ngit --version\n\n\n\n→ Outputs any Git version\n\n\n\n✔︎ PostgreSQL is installed\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\npostgres --version\n\n\n\n→ Outputs any PostgreSQL version. Ideally 11+\n\n\n\n✔︎ GitLab or GitHub account created\n\n\n\n✔︎ Heroku account created\n\n\n\n✔︎ Heroku CLI installed\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\nheroku --version\n\n\n\n→ Outputs any Heroku CLI version\n\n\n\n\n"},"chapters/starting_the_project.html":{"url":"chapters/starting_the_project.html","title":"Starting the project","keywords":"","body":"\nStarting the project\n\n\nNow that all the prerequisites are fullfilled it is time to start the real work.\nWe will create our project folder, a local Git repository and a virtual environment.\nThen we will add Django to the mix.\n\n\nBeginning with the basics\n\nGit will keep track of our file versioning and will be our gateway to distribute the files to GitLab and Heroku later.\nBy using a virtual environment we have an isolated sandbox avoiding confusion with Python versions and modules that may be installed on the operating system already.\nBoth Git and a virtual environment are mandatory for a streamlined Heroku workflow.\nBut it is generally a good practice to start any Python projects that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this book the project will be called \"djangoku_dev\" and you will see that the root path to the project is djangoku_dev.\nObviously you will have your custom path and maybe a more suitable project name – Keep in mind that you have to adjust some commands accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the project folder\n\nCreate a project folder and navigate with the terminal to it:\n\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\nmkdir djangoku_dev\ncd djangoku_dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are on the Mac, there is an easy way to do this:\nCreate the project folder in the Finder, open a new Terminal window, write cd, drag the folder from the Finder into the Terminal window and hit Enter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiate a new Git repository\n\nInitiate a new Git repository:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit init\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good idea to create a Readme file at the beginning of a project.\nWe will create this file later when we push our repository to GitLab.\nFeel free to create it now and add information along the way.\nDo not add any sensitive data to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the virtual environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are confused about virtual environments (as I still am sometimes), check out this great article on Real Python to get an overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this book the virtual environment will be called virtualenv.\nYou can name your virtual environment any way you want and adjust the commands accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtualenvironment in your project folder and activate it:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npython3 -m venv virtualenv\nsource virtualenv/bin/activate\n\n\n\nYou can see that you have activated the virtual environment if the project foldername is between in parenthesis e.g. (virtualenv)\n\n\nThis virtual environment folder is needed only locally.\nGitLab and Heroku will create their own environments later.\nTherefore it is important not to track the virtual environment folder with Git.\n\n\nCreate a .gitignore file and add virtualenv to it:\n\n\nTerminal\n\necho virtualenv > .gitignore\n\n\n\n\nAdding your first commit\n\nNow that we have created the base layer for our project, we should do our first commit.\n\n\nStage all changed files – that’s just the .gitignore file as we ignored everything else – and commit them:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Start djangoku 🌱\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDjango. Finally!\n\nAfter all this preparation and groundwork it is finally time to add Django.\n\n\nInstall Django\n\nMake sure the virtualenvironment is still activated by checking if the project folder is between in parenthesis.\n\n\nInstall the Django module:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npip install django\n\n\n\n\nStart the Django project\n\nNow that the Django module was installed, we can start the actual Django project.\nNote that the command has a . at the end – this will make sure we create the Django project in the current directory and not create a new one.\n\n\nStart the Django project:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ndjango-admin.py startproject djangoku .\n\n\n\nIf you look into your root project folder you should see that a file called manage.py and a djangoku folder were added.\n\n\nRun Django:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npython manage.py runserver\n\n\n\nAfter you have run the command, you should see an address like this: http://127.0.0.1:8000/.\nOpen this in your browser and see if Django is running successfully.\n\n\nTo stop the Django server press Ctrl+c while being in the Terminal.\n\n\n\nIgnore the SQLite database\n\nDjango creates an SQLite database automatically.\nThat’s the db.sqlite3 file in the root folder.\nWe will not need this file and will delete it later, because we will work with a PostgreSQL database.\nFor now it is enough to not track the database file and add it to .gitignore.\nWhen deleted without declaring an alternative database at the same time, Django just recreates db.sqlite3 everytime the server runs.\n\n\nNote that the

value of DEBUG from True to this:\n\n\ndjangoku/settings.py::23\n\nDEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', default=False) == \"True\"\n\n\n\nThis statement does look a bit odd, so let’s see what it does:\n\n\n\n\nos.getenv tries to get the DEBUG env variable.\n\n\nIf DEBUG is not set as an env variable, DEBUG defaults to False.\n\n\nIf the env variable is set to \"True\", DEBUG is set to

Therefore we must check for a \"True\" string, not a boolean.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run Django server now you will see that Django does not run in debug mode.\n(You may even see this: CommandError: You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.)\nLocally we want to continue to see debug messages.\n\n\nAdd DEBUG variable to the .env file and set it to True:\n\n\n'.env'\n\necho \"export

is not important in our local environment, but will be on Heroku.\nHeroku stores the database url in an environment URL, that we access in the Django settings.\n\n\nLet’s install both

advantage of this is that we can connect to different databases on different environments.\n\n\nWe will add a DATABASE_URL variable to the .env file, that contains all information to connect to the database.\nIt will look like this:\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@{host_name}:{port}/{database_name\n\n\nBefore we add it to the .env file, let’s look at the segments of the DATABSE_URL:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment\nInfo\nDefault value\n\n\nuser\nThe user you want to connect with to the database\npostgres\n\n\npassword\nThe password for the user\n` ` (no

not be recreated by Django automatically on launch.\nIf it does, you need to check your settings again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit updates\n\nIf you run git status you will see, that we changed
