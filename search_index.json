start","keywords":"","body":"\nWhat you need to start\n\n\nSince this book tackles a rather specific use case, I assume that you have basic knowledge in Python, Django and GIT.\nThat said the setup you will encounter in the next chapters is kept as basic as possible, so even beginners can follow along.\n\n\nThis book will be based on the version stated in the list below.\nHowever, it is possible to follow the steps with different versions – either older or newer.\nThe general steps will be the same.\nBut there might be differences in details.\n\n\nOn a personal note:\nWhen I started learning programming, I often abandonded tutorials and books, because my code didn’t work as the one in the book.\nI want you to succeed and finish this book.\nIf your code does not work as epxected or you encounter a roadblock, don’t hesitate to contact me and I will try to help out.\n\n\nA word about operating systems\n\nThe screenshots you will see in this book are taken on a Mac.\nBut you can follow this book on Windows and Linux aswell.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\nPython 3.8+\n\n\nGit\n\n\nPostgreSQL 11+\n\n\nGitLab OR GitHub Account\n\n\nHeroku Account\n\n\n\n\nPython and Git\n\nPlease make sure you have Python and Git installed on your system.\nThe easiest way is to google e.g. install python 3 on mac and install git on mac and follow the best results along.\nChances are that Python and Git are already available on your system.\nWhile the git version is not that important, your Python version should be greater than version 3.\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nGenerally speaking you can work with any database that Django and Heroku support.\n(Note: SQLite is not supported).\nThis book is based on PostgreSQL, because you don’t need any additional elements on Heroku and it is easy to setup on Django.\nSince we are only setting up the database and not do fancy interactions with it, the PostgreSQL version you are using is not significant.\nWhile it is alway a good idea to stay recent when starting new projects, you may stick to a version you already have on your system.\nTo see if your version works with Heroku, see this list.\n\n\n\nGitLab account\n\nTo follow along you need an GitLab account.\n\n\nWhy GitLab and not Github?\n\n\nUsually it does not matter that much if you use GitLab or GitHub.\nGitHub is comfortably integrated in heroku.\nYou can even create GitHub actions to create similar workflows for your heroku deployment, as we do with GitLab in this book.\nI personally find working with the GitLab CI/CD pipeline more convenient.\n\n\n\nHeroku account and Heroku CLI\n\nLast but not least, you obviously need an Heroku account to deploy your Django app on Heroku.\nThe good thing about Heroku is, that it is free (how we use it) and scalable (if needed).\n\n\nPlease make also sure that you have installed the Heroku Commandline Interface (CLI).\n\n\n\n\nChecklist\n\nObjective: All prerequisites are fulfilled.\n\n\n✔︎ Python 3+ is installed\n\nTerminal (any window)\n\npython --version\n\n\n\n→ Outputs python version 3+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on how you installed Python 3, you have to use python3 --version or even python3.8

successfully.\n\n\nTo stop the Django server press Ctrl+c while being in the Terminal.\n\n\n\nIgnore the SQLite database\n\nDjango creates an SQLite database automatically.\nThat’s the db.sqlite3 file in the root folder.\nWe will not need this file and delete it later, because we will work with a PostgreSQL database.\nFor now it is enough to not track the database file and add it to .gitignore.\nIf we would only delete it without declaring an alternative database at the same time, Django just recreates db.sqlite3 everytime the server runs.\n\n\nNote that the command has two >, because we want to

different environments (hence the name).\n\n\nTo learn more about best practices for web apps, check out the twelve-factor methodology\n\n\nLocally we will store the environment variables in an .env file.\nLater on GitLab and heroku, those variables can be set in the settings.\n\n\nCreate an .env file:\n\n\nTerminal (same window)\n\ntouch .env\n\n\n\nLet’s ignore the .env file to prevent Git from tracking the content of it.\n\n\nAdd the .env file to .gitignore:\n\n\nTerminal (same window)\n\necho .env >> .gitignore\n\n\n\n\nLoad necessary modules\n\nTo easily load and get environment variables in Django, we use the python-dotenv module.\n\n\nAdd python-dotenv to the project:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npip install python-dotenv\n\n\n\nImport  os and python`dotenv to the Django settings and load latter:\n\n\ndjangoku/settings.py (Beginning of the file)\n\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n\n\n\nCreate an easy DEBUG switch\n\nThe Django debug mode should be turned off in production.\nLocally or in a staging environment it might be useful to see the Django debug messages.\nThat’s why we want to set the debug mode for the environment separately.\n\n\nChange the value of DEBUG from True to this:\n\n\ndjangoku/settings.py::23\n\nDEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', default=False) == \"True\"\n\n\n\nThis statement does look a bit odd, so let’s see what it does:\n\n\n\n\nos.getenv tries to get the DEBUG env variable.\n\n\nIf DEBUG is not set as an env variable, DEBUG defaults to False.\n\n\nIf the env variable is set to \"True\", DEBUG is set to True.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMind that environment variables are read as strings. Therefore we must check for a \"True\" string, not a boolean.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run Django server now you will see that Django does not run in debug mode.\n(You may even see this: CommandError: You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.)\nLocally we want to continue to see debug messages.\n\n\nAdd DEBUG variable to the .env file and set it to True:\n\n\n'.env'\n\necho \"export

a look in the settings file around line 23 you see the current value of Django’s SECRET_KEY.\n\n\ndjangoku/settings.py::23\n\n# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!\nSECRET_KEY = 'mp#qzy1(u!!)ch!s7-d@4rybwz2-r5^l%cy699=v=uyqo%ucsv'\n\n\n\nSince we already added this file to Git, we need to create a new SECRET_KEY, add it to our .env file as a variable and reference it in the settings file.\n\n\nStart the Django shell in the terminal:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npython manage.py shell\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\nfrom django.core.management.utils import

os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')\n\n\n\nRun python manage.py runserver to see if the server starts as expected.\n\n\n\nCommit updates\n\nIf you run git status you will see, that we changed .gitignore and djangoku/settings.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should not see the .env file listed when you run git status.\nIf you do, check if it was added correctly to .gitignore.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we commit our changes, we have to update requirements.txt:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n\n\nIf you run git status you should see that requirements.txt is part of the modified files

not important in our local environment, but will be on Heroku.\nHeroku stores the database url in an environment URL, that we access in the Django settings.\n\n\nLet’s install both

advantage of this is that we can connect to different databases on different environments.\n\n\nWe will add a DATABASE_URL variable to the .env file, that contains all information to connect to the database.\nIt will look like this:\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@{host_name}:{port}/{database_name\n\n\nBefore we add it to the .env file, let’s look at the segments of the DATABSE_URL:\n\n\n| Segment | Info | Default value |\n|---|---|---|\n| user | The user you want to connect with to the database| postgres |\n| password | The password for the user | ` (no password) |\n| `host_name | The database host | localhost |\n| port | The database port | 5432 |\n| database_name | The database name you chose before | djangoku_local |\n\n\nLet’s combine the segments to a functional url and add it to .env:\n\n\n'.env'\n\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/djangoku_local\n\n\n\nNow we need to tell Django to use this database instead of the standard
